# simple-tailwind-exercise
A responsive, minimalist landing page built with HTML5 and Tailwind CSS. This project features a modern glassmorphism design, responsive navigation, and interactive hover effects. <br>
🌟 Features Responsive Navigation Bar:  Sticky positioning to stay at the top while scrolling.  Flexbox layout that adapts to mobile (hidden) and desktop screens.  Hover effects on links (color change, translation, and scaling).  Glassmorphism UI:  Utilizes backdrop-blur-3xl and semi-transparent backgrounds to create a modern "frosted glass" effect on the central card.
