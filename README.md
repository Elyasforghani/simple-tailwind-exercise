# simple-tailwind-exercise
A responsive, minimalist landing page built with HTML5 and Tailwind CSS. This project features a modern glassmorphism design, responsive navigation, and interactive hover effects.  🌟 Features Responsive Navigation Bar:  Sticky positioning to stay at the top while scrolling.  Flexbox layout that adapts to mobile (hidden) and desktop screens.  Hover effects on links (color change, translation, and scaling).  Glassmorphism UI:  Utilizes backdrop-blur-3xl and semi-transparent backgrounds to create a modern "frosted glass" effect on the central card.  Hero Section:  Fixed position background image.  Centered welcome message.  Tailwind Utility First:  Heavy use of arbitrary values (e.g., top-[95px]) for precise control.  Group hover states for interactive elements.  🛠️ Tech Stack Structure: HTML5  Styling: Tailwind CSS (via CLI)  Font: Sans-serif (default Tailwind stack)  📂 Project Structure Based on the paths referenced in the code, your project directory should look like this:  Plaintext  . ├── index.html └── src/     ├── stlyesheet/        <-- Note: Kept spelling as per your HTML     │   ├── master.css     (Input CSS)     │   └── out.css        (Compiled Tailwind Output)     └── img/         └── 4121998_89181.jpg 🚀 Getting Started Prerequisites You need Node.js installed to run the Tailwind CLI.
